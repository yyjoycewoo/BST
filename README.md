- Keep track of a node's parent

- Find the height of a BST

- Search for a specific node

- Insert a node (ignoring duplicate values)

- Delete a node in an optimal way so as to decrease the larger height

- Find a range of nodes that fit a particular criterion

- Find the in-order predecessor and in-order successor of any node in the tree.
